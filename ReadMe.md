## Here are the installation instructions
# install libraries
```
pip install gymnasium torch matplotlib ipython
```



## Here is how you can run the code
Note that the training was actually done in ipynb notebooks on google colab and kaggle, but we converted to python files for more modularity of code.


# Against win-block player
```
python dynamic_test_model.py --opponent wb
```
# Against random player
```
python dynamic_test_model.py --opponent random
```
# Against minimax
```
python dynamic_test_model.py --opponent minimax
```
# Against heuristic player
```
python dynamic_test_model.py --opponent heuristic
```


## Here is how you can see a sample game

# Against win-block player
```
